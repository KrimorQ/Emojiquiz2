# Emojiquiz2

This is a work in progress for a simple daily emoji quiz website. The page serves one set of five puzzles each day. You get three lives to solve them.
Your streak of consecutive days played is stored locally. After a three day streak you earn a bonus hint that reveals the first letter of the answer.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` in a web browser or serve the project directory with a simple HTTP server, e.g.

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
